# glados_api

Rebuilt the Glados Domotics API (Flask) in Django : 
https://github.com/glados-domotics/api

Two diff at the moment : 

1 - Tests are not working properly on Entity because UUID are not created the same (might have missed something in Flask code) => now UUID are forced in testing ;

2 - For now, I've got trouble with setting up the 404 page (status code is never 404). 


BUT instead of being stuck there, I'd rather start coding other parts (not really TDD, but I would never finish the exercice).


EXERCISE 2 COMPLETED
